<b>Short Bio</b><br />
<br>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/">Kyoto University</a>, working in the <a
	href="http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp">Speech and Audio Processing Lab. (kawaharalab)</a>, supervised by <a
	href="http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/kawahara/">Prof. Tatsuya Kawahara</a>. My research interests lie in the application of machine learning
methods for speech and language tasks. 
<br>I am currently working on a spoken language translation corpus of Khmer, English and French, using a court dataset namely: <a href="https://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">ECCC</a>. With this dataset, I am focusing on improving Khmer automatic speech recognition (ASR): <br />
<ul>
	<li>Joint training ASR and speaker recognition</li>
	<li>Joint training ASR and machine/speech translation.</li>
	<li>Other ...</li>
</ul>
