<b>Short Bio</b><br />
<br> Dr. Kak Soky received his M.E. degree in 2016 under supervision by Dr. Sam Sethserey, the Royal University of Phnom Penh, Phnom Penh, Cambodia and his Ph.D. degree from Kyoto University under supervison by <a href="http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/kawahara/">Prof. Tatsuya Kawahara</a>. His research interests lie in applying machine learning methods for speech and language tasks, including automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and speech translation. He is a member of the IEEE. 
<br>He is currently working on a spoken language translation corpus of Khmer, English and French, using a court dataset namely: <a href="https://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">ECCC</a>. With this dataset, I am focusing on improving Khmer automatic speech recognition (ASR): <br />
<ul>
	<li>Joint training ASR and speaker recognition</li>
	<li>Joint training ASR and machine/speech translation.</li>
	<li>Finetuning the XLS-R model</li>
	<li>and so on...</li>
</ul>
